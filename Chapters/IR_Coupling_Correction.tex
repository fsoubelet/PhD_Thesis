% Previous chapters have covered how beam-based corrections of linear optics and nonlinear dynamics in colliders are essential for both beam control and in order to achieve the desired luminosity goals.
The linear optics and coupling correction usually constitute the first phase of machine commissioning as both are major contributors to the performance of colliders, and are required to be under good control for the next phases of commissioning.
In recent years, significant efforts have been made to improve the measurement and correction of linear and nonlinear global coupling both in the LHC~\cite{PRAB:Tomas:Review_Linear_Optics_Measurements, IPAC:Tomas:Measurement_Coupling_RDTs_LHC_AC_Dipole, PRAB:Calaga:Coupling_Merging_Hamiltonian_Matrix_Approaches, PRAB:Maclean:First_Nonlinear_Errors, PRAB:Maclean:Optics_Commissioning_Nonlinear_Era, PRAB:Persson:Chromatic_Coupling_Correction, PRAB:Tomas:ADECTA, IPAC:Maclean:ADECTA_Octupoles, PRAB:Biancacci:AC_Dipoles_Localize_Sources_Beam_Coupling_Impedance, CERN:Maclean:Demonstration_Coupling_Correction_Below_PerMil_LHC} and other synchrotrons~\cite{PRAB:Tian:Genetic_Algorithms_Storage_Ring, PRAB:Ohnishi:Measurement_Chromatic_XY_Coupling, PRAB:Carla:Local_Transverse_Coupling_Impedance_Measurements_Synchrotron_Light_Source, PRAB:Shen:Application_Independent_Component_Analysis_AC_Dipole_Based_Optics_Measurement_Correction_Relativistic_Heavy_Ion_Collider, PRAB:Sagan:Betatron_Phase_Coupling_Measurements_Cornell_Electron_Positron_Storage_Ring, PRAB:Fischer:Robust_Linear_Coupling_Correction_NTurn_Maps, ARXIV:Franchi:Error_Analysis_Linear_Optics_Measurements_Turn_Turn_Beam_Position_Data_Circular_Accelerators, PRAB:Tomas:Measurement_Local_Global_Resonance_Terms, NIMP:Yang:Method_Simultaneous_Linear_Optics_Coupling_Correction_Storage_Rings_Turn_Turn_Beam_Position_Monitor_Data, NIMP:Xiaobiao:Online_Optimization_Accelerators, IEEE:Raka:Measurement_Linear_Coupling_Brookhaven_AGS, PRAB:Franchi:Vertical_Emittance_Reduction_Preservation_Electron_Storage_Rings_Resonance_Driving_Terms_Correction, NIMP:Aiba:Ultra_Low_Vertical_Emittance_SLS_Systematic_Random_Optimization}, as its effect can lead to instabilities and unwanted dynamics in the machine~\cite{IPAC:Maclean:Effect_Coupling_Nonlinear_Observables, PRAB:Carver:Transverse_Instabilities_With_Coupling, PRAB:Franchi:Emittance_Sharing_Coupling, EPAC:Metral:Destabilising_Effect_Linear_Coupling_HERA_Proton_Ring, PRAB:Biancacci:AC_Dipoles_Localize_Sources_Beam_Coupling_Impedance}.

In the LHC local coupling correction has so far been done with the SbS technique~\cite{PRAB:Tomas:CERN_LHC_OMC}.
The method, however, suffers inherent weaknesses making it not local enough for coupling corrections.
This chapter, which constitutes the core of this thesis, presents a new method that was developed to determine corrections of linear coupling at the IPs.
An overview of the various experimental measurements taken for this work can be found in \cref{appendix:measurement_fills}.

\section{Local Betatron Coupling in the LHC Interaction Regions}
\label{section:local_ir_coupling}

In the LHC, corrections of local IR linear coupling are of importance to keep a good control of beam sizes at the IPs and hence the luminosity performance, as well as to prevent a significant impact on the beam dynamics.

In \cref{equation:coupling_rdts_from_skew_quads} the contribution of elements to the linear coupling RDTs is given, where contributing elements are typically skew quadrupoles and solenoids.
The amplitude of the contribution is dominated by the integrated strength of the magnet \(k L\) as well as the \(\sqrt{\beta_x \beta_y}\) term at the location of the magnet.
Given that a tilted quadrupole interacts with the beam as a straight quadrupole with an additional skew quadrupolar component, once can see from \cref{figure:ir5_and_around} that any tilt in the triplet quadrupoles would generate a massive contribution to the coupling RDTs due to the very high \(\beta\)-functions in these magnets.

\Cref{figure:triplet_tilts_to_rdts} shows the coupling RDTs' amplitudes from tilts in triplet quadrupoles, with the \(\beta^{\ast} =\)~\qty{30}{\centi\meter} \num{2022} optics.
In this MAD-X simulation triplets around IP\num{1} were assigned random tilts within \(\pm\)~\qty{1.5}{\milli\radian}, and these were the only contribution to coupling in the machine.
Nevertheless, this contribution amounted to a \(\abs{C^{-}}\) of \num{3.84e-2}, too high for machine operation.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.99\columnwidth]{Figures/IR_Coupling_Correction/triplet_tilts_to_rdts.pdf}
    \caption{Amplitudes of the coupling RDTs (bottom) \(f_{1001}\) (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}) and \(f_{1010}\) (\textcolor{mplorange}{orange}) from tilts in the triplet quadrupoles around IP\num{1}. The top plot shows the magnets' powering while the middle plot shows the assigned tilts in each element.}
    \label{figure:triplet_tilts_to_rdts}
\end{figure}

As a consequence, the IR contribution - mainly the triplets - to global coupling needs to be compensated.
For this, in the LHC the local coupling correction is done by measuring the RDTs in the vicinity of the IP and using the MQSX skew quadrupole correctors introduced in \cref{subsection:lhc_eirs} and showcased in \cref{figure:ir5_and_around,figure:lhc_ir_corrector_layout} for correction.
The corrections are determined with the Segment-by-Segment technique described in \cref{subsection:correction_principles}, and try to cancel the triplets' contribution as well as possible.
Though this compensation is rarely perfect, the residual contribution is usually small enough to be handled by the skew quadrupole correctors present in the LHC arcs (see \cref{subsection:lhc_arcs}).
This correction is essential in order to reach low \(\beta^{\ast}\) with good optics control: at \(\beta^{*}=\) \qty{30}{\centi\meter} the local errors compensated in Run~\num{2}~\cite{CERN:Persson:LHCOpticsCorrectionsEvian2019} would contribute to the \(\abs{C^{-}}\) by the amount of \num{0.33}, too high for the arc correctors to handle.
While such coupling in the machine is not inherently unstable in itself, it leads to other effects causing the machine to be unstable such as transverse instabilities from loss of Landau damping~\cite{MASTERS:Soubelet:Optics_Octupole_PyHEADTAIL,PRAB:Carver:Transverse_Instabilities_With_Coupling}.

Due to their location the MQSX correctors are single aperture magnets, meaning that both beams pass through a single cavity in the element and feel the same magnetic field.
This means finding a correction has the additional constraint that it is applied to both beam~\num{1} and beam~\num{2} simultaneously, and should be a compromise that works for both beams.
As the triplet quadrupoles - also single aperture magnets - are expected to be most of the contribution to local coupling, the local error to be corrected should be the same for both beams and such an arrangement of correctors is manageable.

During the late \num{2018} ion run in the LHC Run~\num{2}, it was observed that while global coupling was well corrected, a local coupling bump in the IR\num{2} had a significant impact on collisions and led to a reduction of the luminosity at the affected IP by up to \qty{50}{\percent}~\cite{IPAC:Jowett:LHC_2018_Heavy_Ion_Run, IPAC:Tomas:Run2_Experience_View_LHC_HLLHC, CERN:Persson:LHCOpticsCorrectionsEvian2019}.
Investigations revealed that a coupling bump around IP\num{2} led to a strong increase in beam size and a drop in collisions.
Importantly, the incident highlighted that no method existed to correct for the coupling specifically at the IP location.

\Cref{figure:lhc_vs_hllhc_beam_size_and_lumi_growths} shows the expected beam size growth and luminosity decrease from various strengths of such a local coupling bump at IP\num{1} or IP\num{5}, for the LHC at \(\beta^{*}=\) \qty{30}{\centi\meter} and for the HL-LHC at \(\beta^{*}=\) \qty{15}{\centi\meter}.
These results highlight the necessity of a proper handling of local coupling for the Run~\num{3}, as well as for the HL-LHC where it should be about a factor \num{4} more accurate.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/IR_Coupling_Correction/lhc_vs_hllhc_combined.pdf}
    \caption{Relative values of the RMS beam size at IP\num{1} (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}) as well as luminosity (\textcolor{mplorange}{orange}) for different strengths of a local coupling bump around the IP made with skew quadrupoles, for the LHC (filled) and HL-LHC v1.5 (dashed) collision optics.}% Beam sizes are calculated according to \cref{equation:lebedev_beam_size} and luminosities according to \cref{equation:luminosity_double_beams}. In the case of the HL-LHC, the relative beam size increase and subsequent luminosity loss are greater due to the much larger \(\beta\)-functions in the triplet.}
    \label{figure:lhc_vs_hllhc_beam_size_and_lumi_growths}
\end{figure}

In the studies presented in this thesis, various calculations rely heavily on the Ripken parameters mentioned in \cref{subsection:parametrization_of_betatron_coupling}.
For instance, beam sizes are calculated from the \(\beta_{kj}\) terms according to~\cite{IOP:Lebedev:Betatron_Motion_Coupling}:

\begin{equation}
    \langle z \rangle = \sqrt{\varepsilon_1 \beta_{1z} + \varepsilon_2 \beta_{2z}}, \quad z \in\{x, y\} ,
    \label{equation:lebedev_beam_size}
\end{equation}
where \(\varepsilon_1\) and \(\varepsilon_2\) are the horizontal and vertical emittances, respectively.

The validity of this calculation has been verified in simulations by comparing its results to those obtained from other means.
\Cref{figure:lebedev_vs_tracking} shows the relative deviation between computed beam sizes at IP\num{5}, calculated either according to \cref{equation:lebedev_beam_size} or from tracking a particle distribution, under various strengths of local coupling.
In all cases the relative deviation is below \qty{0.25}{\percent}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.99\columnwidth]{Figures/IR_Coupling_Correction/lebedev_vs_tracking.pdf}
    \caption{Relative deviation between beam sizes calculated from Ripken parameters according to \cref{equation:lebedev_beam_size} and from tracking a particle distribution, at an IP affected by coupling for the horizontal (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}) and vertical (\textcolor{mplorange}{orange}) planes.}
    \label{figure:lebedev_vs_tracking}
\end{figure}

At the LHC IPs with round beams, as is the case in Run~\num{3}, the effect of the beam's tilt induced by linear coupling is negligible and its impact manifests as an increase in the beam size, as was the case at IP\num{2} in \num{2018}.
\Cref{figure:ip_ellipses_from_coupling} shows a reconstruction of transverse beam sizes at IP\num{1} (similar for IP\num{5}) under various strengths of a local coupling bump.
While the beam ellipses show a \(\gg\) \qty{99}{\percent} overlap indicating a negligible tilt effect, the beam size in the most affected case is about \qty{250}{\percent} of the uncoupled case.

The ellipses are reconstructed through the \(\sigma_{11}\), \(\sigma_{13}\) and \(\sigma_{33}\) terms of the sigma matrix, obtained from MAD-X.}

\end{figure}

Instantaneous luminosities calculated for~\cref{figure:lhc_vs_hllhc_beam_size_and_lumi_growths}, in the absence of crossing angles, are done so according to~\cite{CERN:Herr:Concept_Luminosity}:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{N_1 N_2 f_{rev} N_b}{2 \pi \sqrt{\left( \sigma_{x, 1}^2 + \sigma_{x, 2}^2 \right)} \sqrt{\left( \sigma_{y, 1}^2 + \sigma_{y, 2}^2 \right)}} ,
    \label{equation:luminosity_double_beams}
\end{equation}
where \(N_{n}\) is the number of protons per bunch in beam \(n\), \(f_{rev}\) the revolution frequency of particles, \(N_b\) the number of bunches per beam and \(\sigma_{z, n}\) is the size at the IP of beam \(n\) in the transverse plane \(z\), calculated according to \cref{equation:lebedev_beam_size}.

\section{Current Correction Methods and Their Limitations}
\label{section:current_correction_methods_and_their_limitations}

While the coupling RDTs contain information on the coupling situation in the machine, looking at their patterns along the ring is not a good indicator of the situation in a specific location.
For instance, \cref{figure:guess_rdts} shows the reconstructed coupling RDTs from two measurements taken during the LHC \num{2022} commissioning.
One of these measurements corresponds to a \qty{20}{\percent} lower measured luminosity at IP\num{1} compared to the other, but it is not possible to tell which is which from looking at the RDTs alone.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.99\linewidth]{Figures/IR_Coupling_Correction/similar_rdts_different_ip1_lumi.pdf}
    \caption{Similarly looking coupling RDTs from two measurements (top and bottom) taken during the LHC \num{2022} commissioning. One scenario leads to a \qty{20}{\percent} instantaneous luminosity decrease at IP\num{1} compared to the other. Can you tell which is which?}
    \label{figure:guess_rdts}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Segment-by-Segment}

The Segment-by-Segment technique mentioned in \cref{section:local_ir_coupling} and used to implement local corrections in the LHC IRs suffers from inherent limitations making it unsuitable for the correction of coupling at the IP.
Firstly, due to unfavorable phase advances in between BPMs in the IRs, it is difficult to get a good measurement of the coupling RDTs in these regions.
As these are reconstructed from the \(h_z^\pm\) coordinates they require reconstruction of the momentum (see \cref{subsection:reconstruction_linear_coupling_rdts}).
Knowing that the phase advance in the IRs is \(\sim 0\) from BPM to BPM, and \(\sim \pi\) from one side of the IP to the other, one can see through \cref{equation:momentum_from_two_bpms} why the momentum reconstruction is difficult at BPMs around an IP.

As a consequence, the reconstruction of coupling RDTs in close proximity to the IPs is inaccurate.
\Cref{figure:beamtest_vs_2022_sbs_abs_f1001_ir1} shows the amplitude of the coupling RDTs propagated with the SbS technique in the IR\num{1} segment, from measurements taken during the LHC \num{2021} beam tests and \num{2022} commissioning.
Not only can large error bars can be noticed on the reconstructed data points, but no given case appears to be specifically better than the other while the \textcolor{mplorange}{orange} line (\num{2022} commissioning) corresponds to a better correction than the \textcolor{mplblue}{blue} one (\num{2021} beam tests).
Given the data patterns and the fact that the orange case corresponds to a better correction, it does not appear that the SbS technique gives a good indication of the local coupling at the IP.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/IR_Coupling_Correction/sbs_coupling_b1_ir1_compare_2021_2022_colin_delta_minus4.pdf}
    \caption{Propagation of the measured \(|f_{1001}|\) and \(|f_{1010}|\) for beam~\num{1} around IP\num{1} (dashed vertical line), measured with two different correction settings. The \num{2022} measurement (\textcolor{mplorange}{orange}) leads to a beam size smaller by \qty{9.2}{\percent} than the \num{2021} one (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}).}
    \label{figure:beamtest_vs_2022_sbs_abs_f1001_ir1}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the SbS technique does not allow one to differentiate the contribution of one individual corrector from the other in the LHC IRs, making it difficult to find the correct balance of left and right powering settings.
Indeed, as both correctors can compensate each other one might find a good compensation of the overall IR contribution to global coupling which also deteriorates the coupling situation at the IP.
Additionally, as the coupling RDTs are reconstructed at BPMs the method cannot provide a measurement to estimate the coupling at the IP as there are no BPMs at the location.

\subsubsection*{Combined Coupling Resonance Driving Terms}

A candidate for a better observable that was considered are the \intro{combined coupling RDTs}~\cite{PRAB:Franchi:First_Simultaneous}, or simply Combined RDTs (CRDTs), \(|\hat{F}_{XY}|\) and \(|\hat{F}_{YX}|\).
These can be expressed from the coupling RDTs, here with a scaling factor, as:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \hat{F}_{xy} &= \frac{\sinh{2 \mathcal{P}}}{\mathcal{P}} \left( f^{\ast}_{1001} - f^{\ast}_{1010} \right)  \text{ ,} \\
        \hat{F}_{yx} &= \frac{\sinh{2 \mathcal{P}}}{\mathcal{P}} \left( f_{1001} + f^{\ast}_{1010} \right)         \text{ ,}
    \end{aligned}
    \label{equation:combined_coupling_rdts}
\end{equation}
where \(2 \mathcal{P} = \sqrt{\abs{2 f_{1010}}^2 - \abs{2 f_{1001}}^2}\) and \(^{\ast}\) denotes the complex conjugate.
These have the advantage that they can be reconstructed directly from the particle coordinates (\(x,y\)) without the need for momentum reconstruction~\cite{PRAB:Hofer:Coupling_Local_Observables}.

Although the CRDTs seemed to work well in straightforward simulations, they were found to not be useful when it came to applying them to more realistic cases or real measurement data.
\Cref{figure:crdt_fxy_nominal_vs_colin_md_2018} shows the reconstructed CRDT \(|\hat{F}_{XY}|\) from measurements done in a late \num{2018} MD, computed with the OMC team's analysis tools~\cite{CODE:OMC:omc3}.
During the MD the first investigations were made on local coupling at the IP, and while little data was collected overall due to a dump of beam~\num{1} it provides a good test bed for a new observable candidate.
Information about the MD fill can be found in \cref{appendix:measurement_fills}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.95\columnwidth]{Figures/IR_Coupling_Correction/crdt_fxy_nominal_vs_colin_md_2018.pdf}
    \caption{Reconstructed CRDT \(|\hat{F}_{XY}|\) around IP\num{2} from measurements at \(\beta^{\ast} =\)~\qty{50}{\centi\meter} during a \num{2018} MD. The \textcolor{mplblue}{blue} lines correspond to \num{2} measurements with the nominal optics, and \textcolor{mplorange}{orange} lines correspond to \num{3} measurements with a local coupling bump implemented around IP\num{2}. The percentages indicate the strength of the AC dipole kicks.}
    \label{figure:crdt_fxy_nominal_vs_colin_md_2018}
\end{figure}

While the error bars are barely visible compared to the large ones in \cref{figure:beamtest_vs_2022_sbs_abs_f1001_ir1}, the main observed issue was a lack of reproducibility between different measurements: different measurements done with identical settings give different results.
Indeed, two identical kicks with nominal optics (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}) give different values of the CRDTs at inner BPMs, sometimes differing by a factor two; and other measurements conducted in the presence of a constant coupling bump (\textcolor{mplorange}{orange}) also demonstrate no consistency in the computed results.
For this reason, the CRDTs were not considered further.

\subsubsection*{K-Modulation}

The usual technique to get a measurement of \(\beta\)-functions at the IP is k-modulation.
Unfortunately, previous studies have shown that k-modulation measurements are robust against the presence of local coupling, both analytically~\cite{PRAB:Hofer:Coupling_Local_Observables, PRAB:Carlier:KModulation_HiLumi} and experimentally in a dedicated Machine Development (MD)~\cite{CERN:Persson:Local_Coupling_IP}.
This prevents the possibility of directly measuring the beam size variation at an IP from local coupling to drive a correction. 
\newline

To summarize, control of local coupling in the LHC IRs is an important goal that should be tackled for Run~\num{3}.
Coupling corrections determined with the segment-by-segment method allow compensating for the IR's contribution to global coupling and are crucial to allow squeezing of the beams as well as safe machine operation.
However, existing methods do not provide a reliable way to drive a minimization of coupling at the IP.
To achieve this goal, two new things are needed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A way to adjust for the coupling at the IP without affecting the rest of the machine, so as not to temper with the compensation of the IR's contribution to global coupling.
    \item A reliable way to measure coupling at the IP in order to drive the correction.
\end{enumerate}
The former can be achieved with a knob described in \cref{section:colinearity_knob}, while the latter was achieved with a new optics configuration presented in \cref{section:rigid_waist_shift_for_local_coupling_correction}.

\section{The Colinearity Knob}
\label{section:colinearity_knob}

The \intro{colinearity knob} is a powering setting convention for the IR skew quadrupole correctors, the MQSX magnets.
Originally designed for a flat optics MD~\cite{CERN:Fartoukh:First_LHC_Flat_Optics_High_Intensity}, the knob acts anti-symmetrically on the left and right corrector magnets.
The definition of the knob is given in \cref{table:colinearity_knob}.
A full definition of the knobs as implemented and used in the LHC can be found in \cref{section:colinearity_knobs_lsa}.

\begin{table}[!hbt]
    \centering
    \begin{tblr}{colspec={ccccc}}
        \hline
        \textbf{Magnet}                     &  \textbf{\(\Delta\)K\(_{1S}\) [m\(^{-2}\)]}  \\

        MQSX.3R[IP] \(\rightarrow K_{1S}\)  &  \num{1E-4}                        \\
        MQSX.3L[IP] \(\rightarrow K_{1S}\)  &  \num{-1E-4}                       \\
        \hline
    \end{tblr}
    \caption{Definition of one unit of the colinearity knob, a powering setting of the IR skew quadrupole correctors.}
    \label{table:colinearity_knob}
\end{table}

In the case of only skew quadrupolar coupling sources \cref{equation:deltaqmin_guignard} becomes a summation over the individual sources and the \(j(s)\) term becomes \(J_w\) - the integrated skew quadrupole strength of the source indexed by \(w\) - in that summation:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \left| C^{-} \right| &= \left| \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum_w \sqrt{\beta_x^w \beta_y^w} J_w e^{-i \left( \phi_x-\phi_y \right) + i \frac{s \Delta}{R}} \right| \\
                             &= \left| \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum_w \sqrt{\beta_x^w \beta_y^w} J_w e^{i \left( \phi_x-\phi_y \right)} \right| + O(\Delta) .
    \end{aligned}
    \label{equation:deltaqmin_guignard_singular}
\end{equation}

In the case of the MQSX magnets, given the \(\sim\)~\qty{180}{\degree} phase advance between the two correctors, the contribution to the global coupling can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta C^{-} &= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum_w \sqrt{\beta_x^w \beta_y^w} J_w \\
                     &= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \left( \sqrt{\beta_x^l \beta_y^l} k_S^l L + \sqrt{\beta_x^r \beta_y^r} k_S^r L \right) ,
    \end{aligned}
    \label{equation:deltaqmin_only_mqsxs}
\end{equation}
with \(k_S^w L = J_w\) the integrated strength of the skew quadrupole at position \(w\), and \(l\) and \(r\) superscripts denoting the corrector left or right of the IP, respectively.

Since for round optics in the LHC the \(\beta\)-functions are by design identical at the two correctors left and right of the IP (see \cref{figure:lhc_ir5_zoomed}) and those have identical lengths, with opposite powering settings as defined in \cref{table:colinearity_knob} and assuming a good \(\beta\)-beating correction this contribution reduces to \num{0}.
Therefore, the knob induces a closed coupling bump going from corrector to corrector around the IP without impacting the machine's global coupling.
\Cref{figure:colinearity_knob_effect} shows the effect of the colinearity knob at different strengths on the \(f_{1001}\).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/IR_Coupling_Correction/colinearity_knob_effect.pdf}
    \caption{Amplitude of the \(f_{1001}\) RDT in the vicinity of IP\num{1} under various strengths of the colinearity knob in the absence (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}, \textcolor{mplorange}{orange} and \textcolor{mplpurple}{purple}) and presence (\textcolor{mplred}{red}) of global coupling in the machine. The location of the MQSX magnets are highlighted as \textcolor{mqsx_green}{green} vertical lines.}
    \label{figure:colinearity_knob_effect}
\end{figure}

One can observe that in all cases without global coupling (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}, \textcolor{mplorange}{orange} and \textcolor{mplpurple}{purple} lines) the \(\abs{f_{1001}}\) falls down to \num{0} outside the MQSX to MQSX zone.
When global coupling is present the \(\abs{f_{1001}}\) goes back to its original value outside the limits of the bump.
A similar plot can be obtained for the \(f_{1010}\).

The trained eye might notice how the amplitude of the RDT does not fall down to exactly \num{0} in the \textcolor{mplblue}{blue}, \textcolor{mplorange}{orange} and \textcolor{mplpurple}{purple} cases.
As mentioned above the phase advance between the two magnets if off of exactly \(\pi\) by \qty{1}{\percent}, and similarly the \(\sqrt{\beta_x \beta_y}\) term is not perfectly equal on each side but off by \qty{0.1}{\percent}.
For all intents and purposes though, these deviations are small enough that the contribution can be considered \num{0}.

Thus, the colinearity knob is an effective tool to introduce a perfectly closed coupling bump in between the MQSXs.
It can be used to modify the coupling specifically at the IP without changing the situation outside the IR, and can therefore act as a second step to adjust coupling locally without affecting the compensation of the IR coupling contribution.

\section{Rigid Waist Shift for Local Coupling Correction}
\label{section:rigid_waist_shift_for_local_coupling_correction}

In order to circumvent the issues related to measuring the local coupling at IP, it then became necessary to find a way to relate it to other measurable quantities.
This is achieved by the application of a \intro{Rigid Waist Shift} (RWS), which changes the machine's optics configuration in the IRs, as presented below.

\subsection{Rigid Waist Shift}
\label{subsection:rigid_waist_shift}

Applying a Rigid Waist Shift to the beam - meaning all four betatron waists moving simultaneously - allows to break the (anti-)symmetry of the optics in the IR.
An RWS is achieved by unbalancing the powering strength of the triplet quadrupoles Q\num{1}-Q\num{3} on either side of the IP anti-symmetrically: over-powering one side and under-powering the other by the same powering delta.
The knob is designed so that a setting of \num{1} will result in a \qty{0.5}{\percent} change in the triplet knob powering (individual magnet trims are not used), which creates a waist shift of \(\sim\)\qty{43.5}{\centi\meter} to the left or right of the IP depending on the unit setting of the knob.
The definition of the knob is given in \cref{table:rigid_waist_shift_knob}.
A full definition of the RWS knobs as implemented and used in the LHC can be found in \cref{section:rigid_waist_shift_knobs_lsa}.

\Cref{figure:rigid_waist_shift_knob_effect_on_waist} shows how applying the knob in a given IR displaces the beam's waists away from the IP location, and also shows how the \(\beta\)-functions at the IP location are modified, using the \(\beta^{\ast} =\) \qty{30}{\centi\metre} optics of \num{2022}.
These were determined in MAD-X simulations by applying the RWS with different strengths settings at IP\num{1} and determining the waist, both numerically with a fine mesh and analytically as described in~\cite{PRAB:Carlier:KModulation_HiLumi}.
Similar results are obtained when performing these simulations for IP\num{5} as the design optics are identical for the two main experiments.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \caption{Simulated effect of the designed RWS knob on the \(\beta^{\ast} =\) \qty{30}{\centi\metre} optics. The \textcolor{mplblue}{blue} line represents the waist displacement from the design location. The \textcolor{mplorange}{orange} and \textcolor{mplgreen}{green} lines represent the horizontal and vertical \(\beta\)-functions change at the IP as the waist is displaced, respectively.}
    \label{figure:rigid_waist_shift_knob_effect_on_waist}
\end{figure}

The waist displacement from the design location (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue} line) is almost completely linear with the knob setting.
One can note that the minima of the parabolas indicating the change of \(\beta\)-functions at the IP (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue} and \textcolor{mplorange}{orange} curves) are not found exactly at the zero knob setting, which is because the LHC design optics include a very small waist at IP\num{1} and IP\num{5}.

In \cref{figure:rigid_waist_shift_knob_effect_on_betas} one can observe how the \(\beta\)-functions are affected by the application of an RWS, also simulated with the \(\beta^{\ast} =\) \qty{30}{\centi\metre} optics of \num{2022}.
In this simulation the lattice was sliced to improve the resolution of the data points, which explains the smoother lines compared to, for instance, \cref{figure:lhc_ir5_zoomed}.
One can observe how the symmetry of the optics in the IR is broken when applying the knob (full vs dashed lines).
Inset zooms are included around the location of the MQSX magnets (\textcolor{mqsx_green}{green} vertical lines), showing how the horizontal and vertical \(\beta\)-functions are modified in their vicinity.
The purpose of this setup is discussed in \cref{subsection:rws_application_and_simulations}.

An identical result is found for IP\num{5}.}

\subsubsection*{Optics Impact and Rematching}

Predictably, the application of an RWS as described above has a strong impact on the optics across the machine: the significant change of \(\beta\)-functions in the triplets sends a beating wave from the IR to the rest of the machine.
Applying an RWS with a unit setting of \num{1}, as defined in \cref{table:rigid_waist_shift_knob}, leads to a \numrange[range-phrase = --]{20}{30}\unit{\percent} increase in \(\beta\)-beating in the machine, depending on the observed beam and plane.
This can be observed in \cref{figure:rigid_waist_shift_betabeating}, where in simulations an RWS was implemented with a unit setting of \num{1} at IP\num{1} and the optics deviations from the nominal scenario were determined across the machine for both beams.
The most affected beam and plane depends on the setting of the RWS: in \cref{figure:rigid_waist_shift_betabeating} beam~\num{1} horizontal and beam~\num{2} vertical are most affected, but these would be beam~\num{1} vertical and beam~\num{2} horizontal if the RWS was applied with a setting of \num{-1}.
Naturally, some strong outliers can be observed in the vicinity of the IP, corresponding to the desired deviation at the IP and in the triplets.

A \numrange{20}{30}\unit{\percent} \(\beta\)-beating is observed through most of the machine, with outliers close to IP\num{1}.}
    \label{figure:rigid_waist_shift_betabeating}
\end{figure}

Such a deviation of the optics has an impact on correction knobs.
For instance, simulations show that application of the RWS causes a \qty{15}{\percent} deviation from the achieved \(\abs{C^{-}}\) to the target value set through the LHC global coupling knobs, used for coupling correction with the arc skew quadrupoles.
Additionally, the optics deviations will change the impact of any errors probed while the RWS is trimmed in, namely the skew quadrupolar impact on the \(\abs{C^{-}}\) (see \cref{equation:deltaqmin_guignard}).
\newline

In order to limit this impact on the optics and guarantee good measurements under an RWS, new correction knobs have been developed that make use of individually powered quadrupoles Q\num{4} to Q\num{10} (included). 
These knobs tune the optics functions and rematch them at the edges of the IR in the large sense.
They were designed with the MAD-X code and a specifically developed Python package that can create these experimental configurations for a given IP in the machine~\cite{CODE:Soubelet:pyrws}.
These knobs are obtained from simulations after applying an RWS in a given IR and iterating several matching routines for quantities of interest at different locations in the machine.
Importantly, no involved magnet sees its powering change by more than \(\sim\)\qty{3}{\percent} with the application of these knobs, which allows for respecting the powering limits of individually powered elements.
% As the rematching knobs depend on the RWS setting and optics configuration, no definition table is available akin to \cref{table:colinearity_knob,table:rigid_waist_shift_knob}, but a full definition of the rematching knobs as implemented and used in the LHC can be found in \cref{section:optics_rematching_knobs_lsa}.
A full definition of the rematching knobs for the \(\beta^{\ast} =\)~\qty{30}{\centi\meter} optics of 2022 as implemented and used in the LHC can be found in \cref{section:optics_rematching_knobs_lsa}.

\Cref{figure:rws_rematching_efficiency} shows a comparison of the simulated optics deviation in the beam~\num{1} horizontal plane, induced by the RWS before (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}) and after (\textcolor{mplorange}{orange}) applying the rematching knob, here implemented at IP\num{1}.
Across the machine the \(\beta\)-beating is brought down by \(\sim\)\qty{20}{\percent} to around \(\sim\)\qty{5}{\percent} depending on the beam and plane compared to the nominal scenario, except for the vicinity of the IP where the wanted deviation is kept.
A \qty{5}{\percent} \(\beta\)-beating across the machine is an acceptable level as it is similar to the level of control achieved during normal operation with all corrections trimmed in, as can be seen in \cref{figure:virgin_vs_corrected_lhcb2}.
While only beam~\num{1} horizontal is shown in this figure, results are similar for all planes of beam~\num{1} and beam~\num{2}.

    \label{figure:rws_rematching_efficiency}
\end{figure}

One can notice that near the IP the beating is also lowered by the rematching, but stays high enough to still break the symmetry of the IR.
\Cref{figure:rws_ir1_rematching_betas} shows the \(\beta\)-functions around IP\num{1} before (full lines) and after (dashed lines) application of the rematching knobs.
One can observe how the deviation between the two cases is negligible and, importantly, in both cases the symmetry of the IR is broken compared to, for instance, \cref{figure:lhc_ir5_zoomed}.

\subsection{Application Concept and Simulations}
\label{subsection:rws_application_and_simulations}

Making away with the optics symmetry of the IR allows to break the locality of any coupling bump, even truly local.

When applying an RWS, the \(\sqrt{\beta_x \beta_y}\) terms and the phase advances change enough that the contribution to global coupling becomes non-zero.
\Cref{figure:rdt_leak} shows the coupling RDTs from a closed coupling bump around the IP created through the colinearity knob, both in the presence (\textcolor{mplr}{red}) and absence (\textcolor{mplb}{blue}) of an RWS.
When applying an RWS and breaking the optics symmetry of the IR, on can observe a leakage of the coupling RDTs outside the limits of the initial coupling bump.
% making the impact of the IR coupling errors measurable everywhere.

% \todo{Important quote from the end of the presentation:}
% "Assuming a limit of \qty{6}{\mega\gray} for the corrector magnets in the triplet, this is expected to be reached in the four \(\mathrm{MCBX.1}\) and four \MQSX by the end of \num{2024}."

% This means in simple terms that MQSX dying will drastically impact the LHC's operations, and potentially shut the machine down.

% \subsection{Tilt of Triplet Elements}

% Talk about what we want to do (tilt Q3 or Q2) to induce a skew component + simulation results.
% Found settings of the Q3 or Q2 that would negate the MQSX one determined in beam test / commissioning.
% Show some plots, and come up with the tilt values that would be needed to do the compensation.

% Also show we have a very minimal beta-beating from this.
% Show we have had a look at different optics (30cm and 1m betastar) and it works for both.

% \subsubsection*{Operational Constraints}

% The LHC systems are not meant for this, but for vertical alignment of these magnets!
% System relies on bellows: 2 pieds IP side and 1 pied other side for Q2 for instance.
% This means that inducing rotation is not only not the design purpose, but also imperfect (on move les 2 pieds pour essayer de mimer une rotation mais c'est pas parfait).
% Would be very good to have a plot of the assemblies here to show what I mean. Ask MP people? See in the LHC design report?

% It is considered by MP people to be quite dangerous to do this unless forced to (read an MQSX dies), especially in cold mass, as if we damage the belows then we're in for 1 year of shutdown to repair it.
% Say that for these reasons we decided not to test this concept in the machine, unfortunately.

% Could show plots here (see "Living with Local Coupling" section of my project update V) about the effect on luminosity: what reduction are we looking at 

% \subsection{Warm Skew Quadrupole Replacement}

% Here talk about how there is space between D1 and TAN for a magnet, and we could put a warm skew quadrupole there.
% Show some schematic.
% Show some calculations of how the gradient should be, how long the element should be etc.

% It has considerations such as being imbalanced (asymmetric) with the remaining MQSX, limiting the available aperture etc.

% \subsection{Feed-Down from High Order Correctors}

% Mention here that we consider using sextupolar and octupolar (MCSSX and MCSX) magnets to generate feed-down to coupling.
% However, these elements are not strong enough to generate the same effect that the MQSX do, so this is not really an option.

% \subsection{Adapting the Optics Squeezing Scheme}

% We could change things in the squeeze to compensate for the absence of an MQSX.
% Potentially squeeze harder on one IP (the one with a missing element).
% Potentially squeeze similarly for both but when the unaffected IP stops the squeeze, the other one keeps going to lower \betastar, and the lost luminosity at beginning of fill is made up for starting this moment.
% Not cool because LHCb prefers long fill + impact on BBLR?

% Plot to show the ratio of luminosity as in PowerPoint?

% \subsection{Potential MDs / Exp. Results}

% Talk about how this could be tested.
% If we do get MD blocks for this in September, include the data here.
