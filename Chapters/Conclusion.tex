Could be good points to raise in the conclusion / discussion of the PhD thesis and for future groundwork.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Maybe something else than trimming the colin knob could be another good scenario (trim one side and change f1001 at IP differently for both beams, correct global coupling etc).
    \item BUT the colin means we don't change the coupling bump in the region because of phase advances (Left and Right compensate) and we can do it at high intensity!
    \item Probably this is not the optimal, which is one of the reasons we can't just optimize by luminosity itself with naive scans!
    \item For machine protection you change AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE with high intensity -> you want the settings you have from commissioning to not be changed if possible during operations.
    \item Lose 2h of physics production beam time 10s of thousands in money (the RF at the moment is 10s of millions)
\end{enumerate}
