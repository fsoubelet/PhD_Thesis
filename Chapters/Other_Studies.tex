\section{Phase Error Dependency on BPM Type and Location in the LHC}

In the LHC and many other circular colliders BPM measurement data constitutes the primary source for optics properties computation.
These measurements and the subsequent results were suspected to be substantially affected by both the type of BPM used for the measurements and the value of the \(\beta\)-functions are the measuring devices.
This study was performed to investigate the influence of these properties on the reconstructed phase value from turn-by-turn data.

In practice the presence of systematic errors can influence different sets of measurements to not be totally independent, but in the following study these are assumed to be independent and identically distributed normal random variables (IID), meaning repeating the same BPM measurement in identical conditions will spawn a range of values forming a Gaussian distribution.
Using the underlying properties of the measurements-derived distributions, one can numerically infer the standard deviation on the phase measurement. \todo{Also mention that this differentiates based on the conditions mentioned above.}

\subsection*{Measurement Data and Underlying Distributions}

The methods and considerations below can be applied on BPM turn-by-turn measurement data from synchrotron machines.
The following analysis was done on data taken during the LHC Run~\num{2}, in \num{2018} and at \(\beta^{\ast} =\)~\qty{30}{\centi\meter}.
Information about the measurement data used for this analysis can be found in \cref{appendix:measurement_fills}.

The suspicions mentioned above come from the fact that different BPM types have different resolution, and higher \(\beta\)-functions lead to better signal-to-noise ratios on measurements.
\todo{Have a ref on this?}
As can be seen in \cref{figure:bpms_betas_histogram}, measuring BPMs are spread across a wide range of \(\beta\)-functions.
It is therefore of interest to have the ability to determine the standard deviation on the phase measurement while differentiating on BPM types and \(\beta\)-functions.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Other_Studies/bpms_betas_histogram.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution of BPM \(\beta\)-functions across the machine for the Run~\num{2} measurements used. A small amount of BPMs located at much higher \(\beta\) are not shown on this plot.}
    \label{figure:bpms_betas_histogram}
\end{figure}

The sum of two IIDs - which our measurements are assumed to be - is also normal.
Using the characteristic function of a normal distribution

\begin{equation}
    \varphi(t) = \exp \left( it \mu - \frac{\sigma^2 t^2}{2} \right) \text{ ,}
    \label{equations:normal_distribution_characteristic_function}
\end{equation}
and given that the characteristic function of the sum of two independent random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) is the product of their respective characteristic functions, one gets:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \varphi_{X+Y}(t) = \varphi_{X}(t) \varphi_{Y}(t) &= \exp \left( it \mu_{X} - \frac{\sigma_{X}^2 t^2}{2} \right) \exp \left(it \mu_{Y} - \frac{\sigma_{Y}^2 t^2}{2} \right)  \text{ ,} \\
                                                         &= \exp \left( it \left( \mu_{X} + \mu_{Y} \right) - \frac{\left( \sigma_{X}^2 + \sigma_{Y}^2 \right) t^2}{2} \right)  \text{ ,}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which corresponds to a normal distribution with its mean being the sum of the two means, and its variance being the sum of the two variances.
Respectively, one can deduce the same for the subtraction of two IIDs by changing the signs.

In particle accelerators, phase advances are measured from BPM to BPM and are, in the simplest form, the result of a subtraction.
As a consequence the repeated phase advance measurements obtained from a given BPM pair form a normal distribution with average phase advance \(\bar{\varphi}\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{\mu}\).
Traditionally, the error on phase advance is computed via the standard deviation of \(N\) measurements:

\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\big(\varphi_{i} - \bar{\varphi} \big)^2 \text{ .}
    \label{equation:phase_error_calculation}
\end{equation}

This means the squares of phase advance (and phase advance error) values \(\varepsilon^2\) form a chi-square distribution, with a number of degrees of freedom  \(k = N - 1\) since the sample mean is subtracted.
Therefore, grouping sufficient BPM pairs of the same type and with similar \(\beta\)-function, and computing the distribution of their \(\varepsilon^2\) one obtains a chi-square distribution.
\Cref{figure:square_errors_histograms} shows those chi-square distributions for different ranges of \(\beta\)-functions combinations between measuring BPMs.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Other_Studies/phase_errors_squared_distributions.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution of the squares of phase measurement errors for different BPM combinations, differentiated by the \(\beta\)-functions at the locations of the measuring BPMs. The different distributions form chi-square distributions. For this plot a few simple categories were established, and a BPM is considered "low" below \(\beta =\)~\qty{100}{\meter}, "high" above \(\beta =\)~\qty{200}{\meter} and "medium" in between.}
    \label{figure:square_errors_histograms}
\end{figure}

Similarly, the positive real square roots of values from this chi-square distribution form a chi distribution, which can be derived with a change of variable \(x=y^2\).
\Cref{figure:phase_errors_histograms} shows these distributions for the same \(\beta\)-function ranges seen in \cref{figure:square_errors_histograms}.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Computing the Standard Deviation on Phase Advance Measurements}

A chi-square distribution with \(k\) degrees of freedom  is the distribution of sum of the squares of \(k\) independent standard normal random variables.
Let \(X_{i}\) represent the \(N\) normal random variables, then the associated standard deviation square is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma^{2} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( X_{i} - \bar{X} \right)^{2} \text{ ,}
    \label{equation:chi2_dist_build_from_normals}
\end{equation}
where \(\bar{X}\) is the sample mean of the normal distribution given by

\begin{equation}
    \bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i} \text{ .}
    \label{equation:normal_mean}
\end{equation}

The standard error used in analysis codes is defined as

\begin{equation}
    (SE)^{2} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( X_{i} - \bar{X} \right)^{2} \text{ .}
    \label{equation:omc3_standard_error}
\end{equation}

The ensemble of \(\sigma^{2}\) values from different sets of measurements form a chi-square distribution. 
The associated Probability Density Function (PDF) for \(k\) degrees of freedom, which is non-zero for positive values only, is given by:

\begin{equation}
    P(x \geq 0, k) = \frac{x^{k/2-1} e^{-x/2}} {2^{k/2} \Gamma(\frac{k}{2})} \text{ .}
    \label{equation:chi2_pdf_equation}
\end{equation}

The \intro{mode} is the value \(x^{*}\) that maximizes the PDF.
In this case, one can notice that for positive values where the PDF is defined, \(x^{*}\) will be the same for \(P(x)\) and \(\log P(x)\).
When adopting the following convention:

\begin{equation}
    \centering
    A(x) = \log P(x) \mbox{,   and  } C =
    \tikz[baseline]{
        \node[draw=red,rounded corners,anchor=base] (m5)
        {\(\displaystyle - \frac{k}{2} \log(2) - \log \Gamma(k/2)\)};
        \node[below of=m5] (12) {constant};
        \draw[-,red] (12) -- (m5)
    } \text{ ,}
    \label{equation:chi2_pdf_derivation_convention}
\end{equation}
one can deduce the value \(x^{*}\) through a simple derivation:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
    A(x)              &= C + \left( \frac{k}{2} - 1 \right) \log(x) - \frac{x}{2} \text{ ,} \\
    \frac{d A(x)}{dx} &= \left( \frac{k}{2} - 1 \right) \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{k - 2 - x}{2x} \text{ .}
	\end{aligned}	
    \label{equation:chi2_pdf_mode_proof}
\end{equation}

Thus, we get that the mode is \(x^{*} = k - 2\).
If \(k \leq 2\) then the mode is 0, since the PDF in that case is strictly decreasing with \(x\).
\Cref{figure:chisquare_demo_fit} illustrates this property with a generated chi-square distribution and its PDF, highlighting the determined location of the mode from a distribution fit.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Other_Studies/phase_chisquare_demo_fit.pdf}
    \caption{A randomly generated chi-square distribution (\textcolor{mplblue}{blue}) with \(k = 4\) degrees of freedom, and a numerically fit probability density function (\textcolor{mplorange}{orange}). The determined mode (\textcolor{mplred}{red}) is indeed located at \(k - 2 = 2\). Here 'df' (degrees of freedom), 'loc' (horizontal offset) and 'scale' (a scaling factor) are parameters determined during the fit. The horizontal axis is in units of sigmas square.}
    \label{figure:chisquare_demo_fit}
\end{figure}

The standard deviation of the phase measurements \(\sigma_{\mu}\) is then given from the mode by:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\mu} = \sqrt{\frac{(\epsilon^2)^*}{k - 2}} = \sqrt{\frac{(\epsilon^2)^*}{N - 3}} \text{ .}
    \label{equation:stdev_from_chi2_mode}
\end{equation}

For the chi distribution mentioned above and derived through \(x = y^2\), the associated probability density function of \cref{equation:chi2_pdf_equation} becomes:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        P_{\sigma}(y , k) &= P (y^2 , k) 2y \text{ ,} \\
        P_{\sigma}(y , k) &= \frac{y^{k-1} e^{-y^2/2}} {2^{k/2-1} \Gamma(\frac{k}{2})} \text{ .}
    \end{aligned}
    \label{equation:chi_pdf}  
\end{equation}

For this chi distribution, the mode of \(P_{\sigma}(y , k)\) is at \(y^*=\sqrt{k-1}\) and \cref{equation:stdev_from_chi2_mode} above becomes:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\mu} = \frac{y^*}{\sqrt{k - 1}} = \frac{y^*}{\sqrt{N - 2}} \text{ .}
    \label{equation:stdev_from_mode}
\end{equation}

However, for non-perfect distributions it is numerically difficult to accurately detect this mode: one can use the mode of a fitted probability density function (as done in \cref{figure:chisquare_demo_fit} on a perfect chi-square distribution) but suffer from the quality of the fit, or try to detect the highest bins from the distribution's histogram but suffer from bin resolution and outlier data points skewing the result.

It is possible to use other properties than the mode.
For instance, similarly shown as previously for the mode, one can compute back the desired standard deviation using the mean of the chi distribution through:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
        \sigma_{\mu} &= \frac{\mu}{T} \text{ ,} \\
        T            &= \sqrt{2} \frac{\Gamma((k + 1) / 2)}{\Gamma(k / 2)} \text{ ,}
	\end{aligned}	
    \label{equation:stdev_from_chi_mean}
\end{equation}
where \(\sigma_{\mu}\) is the phase measurement's standard deviation, \(\mu\) is the chi distribution's mean, \(k\) is the chi distribution's degrees of freedom and \(\Gamma\) is the Gamma function.

\subsection*{Application to Measurements}

Due to the presence of many outliers (see \cref{figure:bpms_betas_histogram}) and the lack of a sufficient number of data points in some BPM type categories, the calculation from the mean of the chi distribution seen in \cref{equation:stdev_from_chi_mean} was used in the results presented below.

Optics analysis was run on turn-by-turn data, and BPMs were categorized based on their types~\cite{CERN:Equipment_Codes} and the value of \(\beta\)-functions at their locations.
Both the chi distributions and the chi-square distributions are generated as detailed above, respectively from the phase advance standard errors and from the square of these errors.
\Cref{figure:grid_distributions_standard_standard} shows the distributions of phase errors for different \(\beta\)-functions combinations among so-called \textit{standard} BPMs, the most common ones in the LHC.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Other_Studies/phase_grid_distributions_errors_standard_standard.pdf}
    \caption{Phase error distributions for different BPM \(\beta\) combinations, for \textit{standard} to \textit{standard} type BPMs.}
    \label{figure:grid_distributions_standard_standard}
\end{figure}

For each of these cases, the mean of the distribution is computed and the calculation from \cref{equation:stdev_from_chi_mean} is used.
Depending on parameters set for the optics analysis one might have to apply a correcting factor of \(\sqrt{N-1}\) - with \(N\) being the number of measurements used for the analysis - to compensate for this factor being already present in calculations performed by the analysis software.
Namely, choosing to ignore \(t\)-value correction and single file uncertainty makes this factor appear in the optics calculations and requires to leave it out in later on analysis.
Values inferred with this method for an LHC Run~\num{2} for \textit{standard} type BPMs can be seen in \cref{figure:phase_error_heatmap_standard_bpms}.
Results for all BPM types were also computed but are not shown.% can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:stripline_error_heatmap} and Fig.~\ref{fig:warm_error_heatmap}.

Overall the results are in line with expectations: BPM types with lower resolution such as warm BPMs or wide-aperture BPMs consistently yield a higher standard deviation on phase errors than for instance standard BPMs.
Similarly, BPMs placed at higher \(\beta\)-functions offer better results.

    \label{figure:phase_error_heatmap_standard_bpms}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Conclusions}

Using the normal nature of BPM measurements, one can make use of the underlying properties of the chi-square and chi statistical distributions in order to compute the standard deviation of phase measurement while also differentiating between categories of BPMs.
The suspected dependency of said standard deviation on both measuring BPMs' types and their \(\beta\)-functions has been confirmed.
The ability to accurately compute key statistical values on phase advance measurements - but also potentially a number of optics values later on computed from phase - while differentiating on arbitrary BPM categories opens up potential applications in analysis algorithms, for instance refining the phase accuracy in  harmonic analysis or optimizing BPM selection in the N-BPM method.

\section{Simulations of Sextupolar Contribution to Amplitude Detuning in the LHC}

\todo{Write / include a small section on amplitude detuning in the theory chapter.}

As mentioned in \cref{chapter:Theory}, a measurement of the machine nonlinearities can be obtained by characterizing the amplitude detuning: the dependency of the tune as a function of the amplitude of particle oscillations.
Amplitude detuning traditionally comes from octupolar fields and is used for beam stabilization against collective effects.
More generally, it comes from multipolar fields of even order \(m = 2n\), where \(n\) is a natural number strictly higher than one, since quadrupolar fields provide a linear behavior.

Analytical formulae from \cite{REPORT:Bengtsson:Smear_Tune_Shift, BOOK:Lee:Accelerator_physics,BOOK:Chao:Handbook_Accelerator_Physics_Engineering} show that second order terms of sextupole strengths contribute to free amplitude detuning.
It has previously been suspected that the forced amplitude detuning induced by sextupolar fields would behave similarly than that already studied for octupolar fields in~\cite{PRAB:White:Direct_Amplitude_Detuning_AC_Dipole}.
This study aims to first demonstrate the possibility of measuring this amplitude detuning with AC dipole excitation as previous works have shown that not all higher order effects can be measured with driven oscillations~\cite{PRAB:Persson:Suppression_Amplitude_Dependent_Closest_Tune_Approach}.
Simulations were performed to investigate the sextupolar amplitude detuning in the LHC lattice, both through forced oscillations with AC dipole and free oscillations up to similarly high amplitudes.

\subsection*{Amplitude Detuning with an AC Dipole}

The feasibility of direct amplitude detuning measurement with an AC dipole was demonstrated in~\cite{PRAB:White:Direct_Amplitude_Detuning_AC_Dipole}, as well as its benefits compared to the previously traditional technique of exciting the beam to large amplitudes with a single kick.
In the same paper, the authors go over the linear motion of particles and differentiate two cases.
The parametrization of the transverse coordinate \(z\) in the case of free and forced oscillations with an AC dipole is given by \cref{equation:free_transverse_motion} and \cref{equation:driven_transverse_motion}, respectively.

Analysis of the \(\beta\)-function of the driven particle, \(\beta_D\), can be found in~\cite{PHD:Miyamoto,PRAB:Miyamoto:Parametrization_Driven_Betatron_Oscillation,PRAB:White:Direct_Amplitude_Detuning_AC_Dipole}.
It is derived, still in~\cite{PRAB:White:Direct_Amplitude_Detuning_AC_Dipole}, that for multipoles of even order \(m = 2n\) the amplitude detuning in the case of horizontally driven oscillations is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta Q_x &= \frac{q B_{2n}}{2np} \frac{2^{-n}}{2 \pi} \frac{(2n)!}{(n-1)! (n-1)!} \beta_x \beta_{D,x}^{n-1} A^{n-1} \text{ ,} \\
        \Delta Q_y &= -\frac{q B_{2n}}{2np} \frac{2^{-n}}{2 \pi} \frac{(2n)!}{(n-1)! (n-1)!} \beta_y \beta_{D,x}^{n-1} A^{n-1} \text{ ,}
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eqn:transverse_amp_det}
\end{equation}
where \(q\) is the charge of the particle, \(p\) its momentum and \(B_{2n}\) the gradient of the multipole of order \(2n\) providing the detuning.
Importantly, it is analytically shown that, neglecting the typically small difference between \(\beta_z\) and \(\beta_{D,z}\), \textit{"for multipoles of order \(2n\), the direct term of the amplitude detuning measured with an AC dipole will be a factor \(n\) larger than for free oscillations while the cross terms in both cases are equal"}.

This means in the case of octupolar amplitude detuning that the direct term detuning \(Q_{x}(J_{x})\) under AC dipole oscillations is a factor \(n = 2\) stronger than under free oscillations, while the cross term detuning \(Q_{y}(J_{x})\) will be the same in both cases.
It was suspected that in the LHC sextupolar detuning can be measured with ac dipoles and that it behaves similarly with this factor \num{2} observed in the case of even order multipole, while being a multipole of order \num{3} itself.
Tracking simulations were performed to investigate this effect.

\subsection*{Amplitude Detuning via Particle Tracking}

On-momentum particles were tracked with the MAD-X code through the LHC lattice of \num{2018}, with \qty{30}{\centi\meter} optics.
Nonlinearities were stripped down to the only contribution of sextupoles: no magnet errors, crossing angles or orbit bumps were included; and neither octupoles nor higher order magnets were powered.
This way the only non-negligible contribution to amplitude detuning is the sextupolar one.

Tracking was performed under in the case of both free and forced oscillations (in the horizontal plane) with similar amplitudes.
Several scenarios corresponding to different tune separations for the driven motion were explored.
Turn-by-turn data was gathered at all BPMs during the tracking, and the resulting file was analyzed as done for LHC measurements.

\Cref{figure:horizontal_detuning_comparison,figure:vertical_detuning_comparison} show the horizontal and vertical amplitude detuning results, respectively, for both free and driven motion.
For each result a linear regression is performed against the data to determine the detuning coefficient.

\subsection*{Conclusions}

While machine imperfection impede the measurement of strictly the sextupolar amplitude detuning in the LHC, particle tracking simulations confirm the presence of a suspected sextupolar contribution.
\todo{Rephrase this.
Firstly, this study demonstrates our ability to measure sextupolar amplitude detuning with an AC dipole.
Additionally, not only does this detuning appear present, it seems to behave reasonably close to expectations, behaving in a similar way to octupolar amplitude detuning when comparing the case of forced motion and free oscillations.}
