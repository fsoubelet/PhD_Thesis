\chapter{Negative Rigid Waist Shift Measurements}
\label{appendix:inconclusive_measurements}

Results shown in \cref{section:rws_experimental_results} are from measurements in which the \gls{RWS} \gls{knob} was trimmed in with a factor of \num{1}, as defined in \cref{table:rigid_waist_shift_knob}.
As mentioned in \cref{appendix:experimental_knobs} and as can be seen in \cref{figure:rigid_waist_shift_knob_effect_on_waist} the knob can be trimmed with an arbitrary factor, shifting the waist of the beams left or right of the \gls{IP}. 

Measurements have also been conducted in each \gls{IR} with the \gls{RWS} knobs trimmed in with a factor of \num{-1}, which we will call a \concept{negative RWS}.
For these, done under time constraints at the end of experimental shifts, some mistakes were made in the experimental setups and the data was deemed inconclusive after analysis.
Nonetheless, for completeness these results are included below.

\Cref{figure:ir1_b1_neg_measurement} shows the results of a measurement scan done at IR\num{1} for beam \num{1} with a negative RWS.
When preparing for this scan an issue was encountered when trimming in the \gls{optics} rematching knob.
As the knob had been wrongly designed beforehand, it bypassed the powering limits of the Q\num{6} magnets and thus could only be trimmed in the machine with a factor \num{0.7} as the LHC protection system would not allow lower currents.
As a consequence a strong \gls{beta-beating} remained in the machine and cast doubts on the measurement data. 
When comparing this measurement to simulations, data suggests a \textit{very} large error to be corrected: \num{8.5} units of the colinearity knob.
This data was discarded when determining corrections.

\Cref{figure:ir1_b2_neg_measurement} shows the results of a measurement scan done at IR\num{1} for beam \num{2} with a negative RWS.
The same issue as mentioned above was encountered, and the knob could only be trimmed in the machine with a factor \num{0.5}, resulting once again in a strong \(\beta\)-beating in the machine during measurements.
Comparison with simulations once again suggested a \textit{very} large error to be corrected: \num{16} units of the colinearity knob, potentially more if the measurement scan was carried on for longer.
This data was also discarded when determining corrections.

\Cref{figure:ir5_b1_neg_measurement} shows the results of a measurement scan done at IR\num{5} for beam \num{1} with a negative RWS.
During this scan, an issue was made when trimming the optics rematching knob: the rematching knob from the previous scan was not trimmed out of the machine, and as a result a mix of both knobs was present during the measurements.
This led to the experimental setup of the RWS not being properly implemented, and while the measurement data does not suggest an unbelievable correction as in \cref{figure:ir1_b2_neg_measurement}, the failed experimental setup and suspicious shape of the measurements' \glssymbol{Cminus} curve led to this data being discarded when determining corrections.

\Cref{figure:ir5_b2_neg_measurement} shows the results of a measurement scan done at IR\num{5} for beam \num{1} with a negative RWS.
For this measurement scan, no mistake was made in the experimental setup and the data suggests a correction similar to what was found with the scans presented in \cref{subsection:rws_pos_measurements_corrections} (see \cref{table:rws_corrections_summary}).
The success of this measurement clears some doubts on the validity of the negative \gls{RWS}.

Overall, a combination of human mistakes both during the preparation of the experimental setup and during the measurement scans themselves led to the inconclusive measurements of \cref{figure:ir1_b1_neg_measurement,figure:ir1_b2_neg_measurement,figure:ir5_b1_neg_measurement}.
